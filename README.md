# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-3-AI-Virtual-Machines-on-HPC

I made a Tic-Tac-Toe game on High Performance Computer. 
In this game there are 3 virtual machine which two of them are Artificial Intelligience. 
These two virtual machines are two different player on the game and the third one is the machine that store and share the board game of the game. 
It connects the two player and inform them about the board situation.

When I make the player machines AI, I use minimax algorithm which is an algorithm that calculate every possible move recursively and then give the best result. 
Because of that, if AI player play with the human player, human player win possibility is zero. 
Best result he/she can tie.
 Also in this situaiton which is both players are AI, they always tie. If wanted, this situation can be arranged as levels.

The purpose of this game, making artifical intelligent virtual machines on the HPC. 
In this way I get learned about making VM, using HPC and doing AI games.
